# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This is a deep learning project for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, training scripts, and prediction tools.

## Introduction

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal of this project is to train a CNN to classify these images into the correct categories. This README provides an overview of the project and how to use it.

This code does not work because the format of the code got messed up as I was trying to upload it to GitHub as a project from the assignment I was working on.
